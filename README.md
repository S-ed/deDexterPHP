PHP Dexter Malware Decrypt script

Based on Ruby Version of Script by Josh Grunzweig

https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Malware_Analysis/blob/master/Ruby/Dexter/dexter_decode.rb

Some Quote:
```
This is a simple Ruby script that is designed to take the POST data sent by
the Dexter malware, and decode the data present using the Base64 encoded
key that is supplied. More information about how this data is decoded, and
what values are present can be found here:
http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2012/12/the-dexter-malware-getting-your-hands-dirty.html
```
This version uses newline and equal sign chars instead of using arrays.
